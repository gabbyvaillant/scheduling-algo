## Directory Overview 

In this directory, there is a set of deep learning tasks that the user can use to test the scheduling algorithms implemented for this project. Since there are not a lot of publically available datasets giving information on the tasks that data centers execute and the GPU usage associated with them, we have created some tasks to mimic a data center on a smaller scale and can tap into GPUs to create our own GPU usage data.

LSTM tasks: 

(1) IMBD-LSTM.py: Using IMBD dataset

Image Classification tasks:

(1) FMNIST-IC.py: Fashion MNIST dataset

(2) CIFAR-IC.py

(3) MNIST-IC.py: Another MNIST task to use


Transformer tasks:

(1) BERT-TRANSF.py

(2) GPT2-TRANSF.py
