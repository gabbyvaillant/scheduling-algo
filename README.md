# Energy-Efficient Scheduling Algorithms in Cloud Computing: A Hybrid Approach

This project aims to investigate and compare the energy efficiency of scheduling algorithms while also aiming to improve the efficiency of a selected modern scheduling algorithm. We plan to identify which algorithm offers the best trade-off between energy consumption and performance when handling time-varying tasks. We aim to reduce GPU usage and makespan of a particular novel open-source scheduling algorithm.
